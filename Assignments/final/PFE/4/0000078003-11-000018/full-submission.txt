        <footnote id="F1">This amount reflects all of the outstanding shares of Icagen, Inc. (&quot;Icagen&quot;) not owned by Pfizer Inc. (&quot;Pfizer&quot;) and Eclipse Acquisition Corp.  On October 27, 2011, Eclipse Acquisition Corp. was merged with and into Icagen with Icagen continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer.  At the effective time of the merger, these shares of common stock were cancelled and ceased to exist.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Prior to the merger, Pfizer held 100 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Eclipse Acquisition Corp., which represented all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Eclipse Acquisition Corp.  At the effective time of the merger, each share of Eclipse Acquisition Corp. was converted into one share of common stock of Icagen, resulting in the acquisition by Pfizer of 100% of the equity interest of Icagen.</footnote>
